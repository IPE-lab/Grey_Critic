## Description of the project
The sweet spot and fracability evaluation of shale reservoirs are important indicators for shale reservoir exploration and development which can improve the exploration and development effects of shale oil and gas reservoirs and increase economic benefits. This article systematically investigated the commonly used sweet spots and fracability evaluation methods and clarified the relationship between geological sweetness(GS), engineering sweetness(ES), and fracability from the concept and evaluation methods. On this basis, a compressibility evaluation method based on a comprehensive analysis of sweet spots is proposed. This method uses on-site geology and engineering parameters to calculate the geology and engineering sweetness index (GS and ES).
